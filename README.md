# Massive-MIMO

In the following project, an introduction to the concept of **Massive MIMO** is prepared and presented in the form of slides attached to the repository.

To this end, a primary source of reference is used and attached to the project's material, too.

In addition to introducing the basic concept and enablers, some of the diagrams of the reference's paper are simulated in **MATLAB** and scrutinized.

One of the digrams, is dedicated to analyzing the effect of changing the number of servieces on the total spectral efficiency, at SINR= -6 dB, and for number of users accepting these values: k = [16 32 64 128]

The other diagram, shows the effect of .... on the ...., for SINR=0 dB and the the number of users equal to 16. This diagram also represts the ... in comparison to Shannon's limit.
