# Massive-MIMO

In the following project, an introduction to the concept of Massive MIMO is prepared and presented in the form of slides attached to the repository.
To this end, a primary source of reference is used and attached to the project's material, too.

In addition to introducing the basic concept and enablers, some of the diagrams of the reference's paper are simulated in MATLAB and scrutinized.
