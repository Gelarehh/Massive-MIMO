# Massive-MIMO

In the following project, an introduction to the concept of **Massive MIMO** is prepared and presented in the form of slides attached to the repository.

To this end, a primary source of reference is used and attached to the project's material, too.

In addition to introducing fundamental concept enablers, some of the diagrams of the reference's paper are simulated in **MATLAB** and scrutinized.

One of the digrams is dedicated to analyzing the effect of changing the number of services on the total spectral efficiency, at SINR= -6 dB, and for the number of users accepting these values: k = [16 32 64 128]

The other diagram shows the effect of the number of BS antennas on the sum rate, for SINR=0 dB and the number of users equal to 16. This diagram also represents the value of the sum rate in comparison to Shannon's limit.
